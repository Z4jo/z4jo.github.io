# What is it about?
  It's a group of functions that tries to map independent variable x to dependent variable y. Independent variable is a cause for the dependent one e.g height, age and calories intake are independent
  variable for weight which is dependent on them. The variables can be both discrete (categories) and continuous (range) it all depends on what type of function is used. Regressions are using coefficients
  to weight the independent input variables. We can denote coefficients as $a^2$
  Most known regressions are:
  - Linear regression 
  - Logisitc regression 
## Linear regression 
  It is a line that tries to map the linear growth of a function to a dependant variables. In our previous example with weight it would make sense to use the linear regression. The more old person,
  or taller and who eats more is more likely to have more weight. The linear regression output is continuous so not as good for classification like logisitc regression. The input can be multiple variables.
